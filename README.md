## Game Feature
### 1. Selecting pet 
Each pet is associated with a different game difficulty (the more difficult, the faster the pet's energy drops)

Difficult <———————-——> Easy \
Dog ———— Cat ————— Squirrel 

Three buttons with the body color of the pets shown below each pet, select the pet by clicking on the button below the pet.

### 2. Energy
The energy of the pet decreases by time. You are given full 100 energy points in the beginning. You can increase it by feeding the pet you selected.

### 3. Food 
You will need to spend $10 to buy food. You will be given $10 in the beginning. You can earn through quizzes. If the money runs below the cost of buying food (less than $10), the three food button will be deactivated. The buttons will be activated only after the user gains no less than $10 through taking the quiz correctly.

### 4. Your pet is happy/sad!
If you feed your pet with food, your pet will turn into a happy emotion. And if you answer the quiz wrongly, the pet will turn into a sad face.

### 5. Chat
The Chat option is there for your mental health. We care about you! The pet will respond to your feelings and thoughts. The pet will answer “PET ME!” if your pet cannot identify your words.

### 6. Decorations
You can also purchase room decorations since it’s a wonderful holiday season!

## Enjoy the game!
